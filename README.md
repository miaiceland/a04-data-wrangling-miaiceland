# Instructions: Activity 04 - Data Wrangling 



## Instructions 
- Task prompts are in *italics* in the .Rmd file
- Edit the R Notebook in your GitHub Repository and add your answers
- submit the completed R Notebook as .NB.HTML to Canvas before deadline


## Tips

- **always "PULL" before you do anything** when collaborating on a project controlled by GitHub to make sure you are working with the latest code (otherwise you'll have problems) 
- **always "PUSH" when you're done** so your collaborators can pull the latest version of the code.
- **always write descriptive commit messages** 
- Make sure you run all code chunks in your R Notebook before you "preview" the HTML document.  
- Make sure the .NB.HTML document that you submit to Canvas has rendered properly--the header in your .Rmd file needs to specify the output as `html_notebook` for an R Notebook (**NOT** `html_document`)
- When plotting, you can use the `mplot` or `esquisser` function to create the plot in your console. You should then copy the ggplot code and paste it into your Rmd document. There should not be `mplot` or `esquisser` in anything you turn in.
